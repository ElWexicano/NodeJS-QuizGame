NodeQuizGame
============

This is a simple quiz game that is created using Node.js, Expressjs, Mongoose, Mongodb, Jade and Bootstrap for Twitter. It will be deployed to [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.com/) which is an open source PaS.

###Description

The quiz will have the following two components:

1. **The Game**: this is the part of the application that the end-user will interact with to play the quiz. It will include a section which provides the rules to the quiz, records the user's name and location, and allows them play a new game.  

2. **The Quiz Manager**: this component is used by an administrator or manager to add, remove and delete quiz questions. They can also view all the questions that are currently in the quiz.
